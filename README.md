# Old portfolio website

I'd built this site for boosting my CV after I'd finished from Uni and was looking for my first job in software.

It was a theme ([**Self**](https://github.com/NtinosNG/self)) built completely from scratch using HTML/CSS/JS for [HUGO](https://gohugo.io) SSG. It was hosted on [**netlify**](https://netlify.com) and managed with [Forestry](https://forestry.io) CMS.
