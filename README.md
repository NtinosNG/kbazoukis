# My Personal Website
### _Find out who I am and what I have done_.

This website written in HTML and uses Semantic-UI (https://semantic-ui.com/) CSS framework for styling and responsiveness. The design was inspired by various minimalistic themes (https://themes.gohugo.io/tags/minimal/) for Hugo open-source static site generator (https://gohugo.io). 

However, it was not built with Hugo and it's not a theme for Hugo. Also, it doesn't display any real information yet as it is not fully ready. Instead, some example content has been placed in the various sections and it will be replaced when it's finally complete.
