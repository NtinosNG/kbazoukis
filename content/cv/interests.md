<br/>

I'm a person of technology, and for the most part my interests are "geeky"! I like watching **movies** and **TV shows**, playing **video games**, reading **comic books**, experimenting with **DIY** stuff and exploring **new technologies** such as programming languages, tools, Linux distros and other!

However, apart from the part of my life that involves technology, I do enjoy things that most people like!

In my weekly routine I always try to include outdoors **exercise** as it is a very refreshing change of pace and it's also good for health. My activities are mainly **cycling** and **running**, but I do also enjoy **swimming** at the beach during summertime!

Additionally, in my spare time, I enjoy doing **covers** of favourite songs with my **guitar** in order to improve my playing, I like exploring the city in order to **discover "cool" places** or (re)visiting **museums** and **tourist attractions**, and like most people, I really enjoy **hanging out with friends** and doing things together!

Lastly, I aim to **travel** as much as I can as I want to explore other cultures and lifestyles!
