<br/>

Apart from the part of my life that involves technology (and generally looking at a screen!), I actually enjoy doing other things that most people like!

I like **travelling** as I can explore other cultures and their lifestyles.

In my daily routine, I always try to find some time to do outdoors **excersise** as it is a very refreshing change of pace and it's also good for health. My activities are mainly **cycling and running**, although, I do also enjoy **swimming** at the beach during summertime.

In my spare time, I try to do covers of favourite songs with my **guitar** in order to improve my playing, explore the city and **discover new "cool" places**, (re)visit **museums and tourist attractions** and like most people, I really like **hanging out with friends** and doing things together!

Of course, all the aforementioned interests are similar for most people! There other more "geeky" interests that I have such as **watching movies and TV shows** (a bit more fanatically than most "every day people" though!), **gaming**, **reading comic books**, experimenting with **DIY** stuff, exploring **new technologies** such as programming languages, tools, Linux distros and other!
