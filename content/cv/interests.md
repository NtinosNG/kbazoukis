Apart from the part of my life that involves technology (and generally looking at a screen!), I actually enjoy doing other things that most people like!

I like **travelling** as I can explore other cultures and their lifestyles. 

In my daily routine, I always try to find some time to do outdoors **excersise** as it is a very refreshing change of pace and it's also good for health. My activities are mainly cycling and running, although, I do also enjoy swimming at the beach during summertime.

Finally, I really like hanging out with friends and doing stuff together!

Of course, all the aforementioned interests are similar for most people! There other more "geeky" interests that I have such as watching movies and TV shows (a bit more fanatically than most "every day people" though!), gaming, reading comic books, experimenting with DIY stuff, exploring new technologies such as programming languages, tools, Linux distros and other!
