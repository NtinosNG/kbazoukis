### **What was covered in the course**

* 5 real-world projects - learned how to plan and architect applications by using flowcharts and common JavaScript patterns.
* JavaScript fundamentals: variables, if/else, operators, boolean logic, functions, arrays, objects, loops, strings, and more.
* Modern JavaScript (ES6+) from the beginning: arrow functions, destructuring, spread operator, default arguments, optional chaining (ES2020), and more
* How JavaScript works behind the scenes: engines, the call stack, hoisting, scoping, the 'this' keyword, reference values, and more.
* Deep dive into functions: arrow functions, first-class and higher-order functions, bind, and closures.
* Deep dive into object-oriented programming: prototypal inheritance, constructor functions (ES5), classes (ES6), encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.
* Deep dive into asynchronous JavaScript: the event loop, promises, async/await, and error handling. You will use these to access data from third-party APIs with AJAX calls.
* Modern tools that are used by professional web developers: NPM, Parcel (module bundler), Babel, and ES6 modules.
